		<section>
			<h2>What is ICT?</h2>
			<p>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) includes hardware, software, voice communication, video capabilities and digital content (including web and non-web based information).</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What is ICT accessibility and why is it important?</h2>
			<p>"ICT accessibility ensures that people with and without disabilities can access the same information, perform the same tasks, and receive the same services using information technology. It is the digital equivalent to accessibility in the physical environment &mdash;the curb cuts, ramps, railings, etc., of the digital age. While ICT accessibility can provide usability benefits to everyone who uses ICT, it is a vital necessity to many people with disabilities." - <a href="https://www.nascio.org/Publications/ArtMID/485/userid/4997/ArticleID/127/Accessibility-in-IT-Procurement-Part-1">NASCIO - Accessibility in IT Procurement</a></p>

		<section>
			<h2>About this document</h2>
			<p>This document lists relevant ICT accessibility requirements from the EN 301 549 v2.1.2 (2018-08) Harmonised European Standard "Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services", which includes the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA.</p>
			<p>At first glance, some requirements may appear to be unrelated to this product or service. They have been included for consideration since the full feature set of a Vendor&rsquo;s product or service may not be known. For example, a video may be embedded into product documentation, so accessibility requirements for video and audio may become relevant.</p>
			<p>Appendices include definitions, references, and practical guidance on creating accessible documentation.</p>

			<h2>Part A - Functional performance statements</h2>
			<p>These are explanatory (non-testable) statements that introduce the core aspects that the offered product or service must provide to be considered accessible.</p>
			<div class="row wb-eqht">
				<section class="col-md-6">
					<h3>4.2.1. Usage without vision</h3>
					<p>Where ICT provides visual modes of operation, some users need ICT to provide at least one mode of operation that does not require vision.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A web page or application with a well formed semantic structure can allow users without vision to identify, navigate and interact with a visual user interface.</li>
						<li>Audio and tactile user interfaces may contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="col-md-6">
					<h3>4.2.2. Usage with limited vision</h3>
					<p>Where ICT provides visual modes of operation, some users will need the ICT to provide features that enable users to make better use of their limited vision.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Magnification, reduction of required field of vision and control of contrast, brightness and intensity can contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
						<li>Where significant features of the user interface are dependent on depth perception, the provision of additional methods of distinguishing between the features may contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
						<li>Users with limited vision may also benefit from non-visual access (see clause 4.2.1).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="col-md-6">
					<h3>4.2.3. Usage without perception of colour</h3>
					<p>Where ICT provides visual modes of operation, some users will need the ICT to provide a visual mode of operation that does not require user perception of colour.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Where significant features of the user interface are colour-coded, the provision of additional methods of distinguishing between the features may contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="col-md-6">
					<h3>4.2.4. Usage without hearing</h3>
					<p>Where ICT provides auditory modes of operation, some users need ICT to provide at least one mode of operation that does not require hearing.</p>
					<ul>

			<h2>Annex - Definitions and abbreviations (from EN 301 549)</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>3.1 Definitions</h3>
				<p>For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in ETSI EG 201 013 [i.4] and the following apply:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Accessibility</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities can be used by people from a population with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities, to achieve a specified goal in a specified context of use (from ISO 26800 [i.18])</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Context of use includes direct use or use supported by assistive technologies.</li>
							<li>The context in which the ICT is used may affect its overall accessibility. This context could include other products and services with which the ICT may interact.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Assistive technology</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Hardware or software added to or connected to a system that increases accessibility for an individual</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Examples are Braille displays, screen readers, screen magnification software and eye tracking devices that are added to the ICT.</li>
							<li>Where ICT does not support directly connected assistive technology, but which can be operated by a system connected over a network or other remote connection, such a separate system (with any included assistive technology) can also be considered assistive technology.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Audio description</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Additional audible narrative, interleaved with the dialogue, which describes the significant aspects of the visual content of audio-visual media that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone</p>
						<ul>
							<li>This is also variously described using terms such as "video description" or variants such as "descriptive narration".</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Authoring tool</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Software that can be used to create or modify content</p>
						<ul>
							<li>An authoring tool may be used by a single user or multiple users working collaboratively.</li>
							<li>An authoring tool may be a single stand-alone application or be comprised of collections of applications.</li>
							<li>An authoring tool may produce content that is intended for further modification or for use by end-users.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Caption</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Synchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content (after WCAG 2.1 [5])</p>
						<ul>
							<li>This is also variously described using terms such as "subtitles" or variants such as "subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing".</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Closed functionality</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Functionality that is limited by characteristics that prevent a user from attaching, installing or using assistive technology</p>

					<dd>
						<p>Information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of software, including code or mark-up that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions (after WCAG2ICT [i.26])</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Content occurs in three places: web pages, documents and software. When content occurs in a web page or a document, a user agent is needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user. When content occurs in software, a separate user agent is not needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user - the software itself performs that function.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Context of use</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Users, tasks, equipment (hardware, software and materials), and the physical and social environments in which a product is used (from ISO 9241-11 [i.15])</p>

						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Real-time text</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Form of a text conversation in point to point situations or in multipoint conferencing where the text being entered is sent in such a way that the communication is perceived by the user as being continuous</p>

			<h2>Annex - Practical guidance for accessible non-web documentation</h2>
			<p>In WCAG &ldquo;success criteria&rdquo; are all technology agnostic. The requirements for non-web documents are based on the WCAG 2.1 level AA requirements, which means all level A and AA criteria relevant to documents must be met.</p>
			<p>The W3C publishes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/">sufficient techniques</a> to meet WCAG success criteria, including techniques for non-web document formats such as PDF. Using a given technique is considered &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; to meet the criteria relevant to the technique, but you can also meet the criteria in other ways.</p>
			<p>Shared Services Canada has created a set of guides for producing accessible documents in Microsoft Office:</p>
